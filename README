Hopefully this turns into a nice executable (and library?) to run replaygain
over many files.

It should support multiple compression and tag formats.  We shall see.

As much of this will be ISC-licensed as possible. I don't understand the core
Replaygain algorithm, so I copied and modified the LGPL'd libreplaygain from
Musepack. Somebody has to give the author a punch in the face for using
global variables for state.

./autogen.sh
./configure
